# Burger-Logger

## Overview
In this assignment, you'll create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Be sure to follow the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.

## DEPLOYMENT: 
The user has to type npm install first on the terminal, then the user has to type node server.js to initiale the server connection. Go to localhost 8080 on the web browser to open the application.
